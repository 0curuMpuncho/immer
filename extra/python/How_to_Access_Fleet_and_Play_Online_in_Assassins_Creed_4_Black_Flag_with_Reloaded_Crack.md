## What is Reloaded Crack and Why Does It Cause Problems?
 
Reloaded is a group of hackers who release cracked versions of games that bypass the DRM (digital rights management) protection and allow users to play them without purchasing or activating them. Reloaded crack for Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag was released in November 2013, shortly after the game's official launch. The crack works by replacing some files in the game's directory and emulating the Uplay service, which is required to play the game online and access some features like Kenway's Fleet.
 
However, the crack is not perfect and has some drawbacks. First of all, it may cause some stability issues, crashes or errors in the game. Secondly, it may prevent you from accessing some online features like multiplayer mode, leaderboards or Uplay rewards. Thirdly, it may block you from accessing Kenway's Fleet, which is integrated with Uplay and requires an internet connection to work. If you try to access the fleet from the captain's cabin or the map menu, you may get a message saying "Fleet offline" or "Unable to connect to Uplay". This means that you are missing out on a lot of content and benefits that the fleet offers.
